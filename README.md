# Memory-Game

This is a game for desktop only. Make sure you unzip the images before starting the game.

Start by flipping a card. Then try to find another card that has the same image as the first. If you can't find a pair, the flipped cards will be flipped back with the face down. Try to remember these images as it becomes easier to find pairs the longer you play. 
When you match all the cards, you win and the game ends ðŸ˜Š
